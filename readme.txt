The Trackable Social Share Icons plugin enables blog readers to easily share posts via social media networks, including Facebook and Twitter. All share clicks are automatically tracked in your Google Analytics.


== Description ==

Increase the reach of your blog with social network sharing, and track the number of share clicks in Google Analytics.

Trackable Social Share Icons plugin is a simple, intuitive, and customizable plugin that places social media icons, such as Twitter and Facebook, at the bottom of Wordpress posts and pages. Users can click on the icon to share the blog post over social networks without ever leaving the page.

All clicks on the social icons are automatically tracked in your Google Analytics, under Event Tracking. Tracking data is not shared with us or any 3rd party – only someone with access to your Google Analytics will see it in any form.


== Customization Options ==

Trackable Social Share Icons lets you select which social media icons appear (including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Digg, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, Posterous, and Email), choose from a dozen different icon appearances, customize the size of the icons, whether or not to use text along side the icons, and lets you turn the Google Analytics tracking on and off.


== Tracking ==

If you have tracking turned on in the admin, all clicks on your social icons will automatically be tracked in Google Analytics – there is nothing to set up. Social icon clicks will appear in Google Analytics under Content > Event Tracking in a category called SocialSharing. It will break out which buttons were clicked, and let you drill down to see which pages the clicks came from. Note that tracking only works with the new asynchronous analytics code (not the old urchin code).

Trackable Social Share Icons will work even without Google Analytics on your site – though obviously you won’t be able to track the clicks without analytics.

Tracking only works with the newer, asynchronous analytics code (though the rest of the plugin will work fine even without it). The asynchronous analytics code appears in the header of your site code, whereas the old urchin analytics appears in the footer. You can get Google Analytics or upgrade to the new version at any time for free.
